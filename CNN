# CNN<br>

A convolutional neural network (CNN, or ConvNet) is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery.<br>
Convolutional networks were inspired by biological processes in that the connectivity pattern between neurons resembles the organization of the animal visual cortex. Individual cortical neurons respond to stimuli only in a restricted region of the visual field known as the receptive field. The receptive fields of different neurons partially overlap such that they cover the entire visual field.

CNNs use relatively little pre-processing compared to other image classification algorithms. This means that the network learns the filters that in traditional algorithms were hand-engineered. This independence from prior knowledge and human effort in feature design is a major advantage.

# Handwriting recognition<br>
The standard example for machine learning these days is the MNIST data set, a collection of 70,000 handwriting samples of the numbers 0-9.

# Problem statement<br>
To predict which number each handwritten image represents.

# Dataset<br>
Each image is 28x28 grayscale pixels, so we can treat each image as just a 1D array, or tensor, of 784 numbers.

# Modules<br>
tensorflow <br>
keras <br>
matplotlib <br>
numpy <br>
